# My Favorite Things

I'm fond of video games, the source of my passion for computers. Of all games, Doom is my favorite, with Hocus Pocus and Commander Keen following closely behind. If it's FOSS or abandonware, it's in my library.

I'm also a bit of an RPG fan. Though not on the level of the Grognards of old, I've played several editions of D&D, my favorite being AD&D 2nd Edition. I'm currently involved in a Fantasy Craft campaign, playing as Lamont the Crusader. In a series of dungeon crawls with another group, I play Krasnybog the Drake Dragon Lord.
